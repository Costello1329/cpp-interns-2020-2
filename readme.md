### Rules of the game:

##### Lessons:
During the semester I'll upload around 10 lectures to YouTube. Course roadmap can be found in the folder `roadmap`.

##### Homework:
You'll also have 5 homework tasks during the semester. All homeworks cost 70 points in total. It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again – it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also need to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

##### Deadlines:
Each deadline will be stated in the correspoding readme.md file of the task.

##### Exam:
Will be conducted in two steps: online talk and examination contest. In total, exam costs 30 points.

##### Final mark:
Your final mark can be calculated with this formula: `x >= 30 ? round(x / 10) : retake()` where x is your semester score.
