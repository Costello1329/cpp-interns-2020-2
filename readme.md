## Rules of the game:

### Lessons:
During the semester I'll upload around 10 lectures to YouTube. Course roadmap can be found in the folder `roadmap`.

### Homework:
You'll also have 5 homework tasks during the semester. All homeworks cost 70 points in total. It's absolutely prohibited to write off, each task must be solved individualy! We'll ban every writen off solution. Furthermore, we'll also ban the solution wrom which the other student has written off. If the simuation will happen again – it will cause an instant retake for both sides. You'll also need to stick to codestyle guide: [Google codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Deadlines:
Each deadline will be stated in the correspoding readme.md file of the task.

### Exam:
Will be conducted as an online talk. In total, exam costs **30 points**. Each student will have **30 mins** in order to prepare **2** randomly-assigned questions from the [list](https://github.com/Costello1329/cpp-interns-2020-2/blob/master/exam/readme.md) and **30 mins** to answer the assigned questions. It's not prohibited to use anything during the preparation, but it's prohibited during the answer. Each talk will be conducted as a personal Zoom-meeting, time tables will be posted in the tg-chat before the exam.

### Final mark:
Your final mark can be calculated with this formula: `x >= 30 ? round(x / 10) : retake()` where x is your semester score.
